###################

General:
- Integrated A-Darwin (a tool to automatically extract algorithmic species) into the Bones source-tree.
- Added memory transfer optimisations (e.g. CPU-GPU copy optimisations).

A-Darwin:
- Initial test release of A-Darwin (with many limitations)
- Added a 'golden' reference set to test the extraction of species
- Added dependence-test examples

Miscellaneous:
- Substituted the simplify method by a symbolic math library gem ('symbolic').

###################
### v1.1        ###
###################

General:
- Initial release to RubyGems and initial commit to github.
- Added support for a compiler optimisation pass: array substitution with a local register copy in the case of chunk to element species.
- Added support for a compiler optimisation pass: thread-merging, potentially improving re-use through locality at the cost of parallelism.
- Updated and added examples.
- Tuned the skeletons.

Skeletons performance/readability/usability tuning:
- Added a special GPU-CUDA 'chunk(1,N)' skeleton with pre-shuffling (e.g. atax, bicg, mvt, syrk). Added support for a corresponding transformation in Bones.
- Added a special GPU-CUDA 2x'chunk(1,N)' skeleton with pre-shuffling if there are two chunk inputs (e.g. gesummv,syr2k).
- Updated the various OpenCL skeletons to create only once the 'context', 'command queue' and 'program'. This saves significant time for programs executing a single kernel multiple times or multiple kernels subsequently.
- Tune GPU-CUDA skeletons to prefer L1 cache above scratchpad memory.

Examples:
- Updated several benchmarks with additional species.
- Added the 'saxpy' benchmark.
- Added 'example12' to demonstrate the use of species in a separate function.

Bug fixes:
- Removed the generation of global code in case no species are detected.

Miscellaneous:
- Renamed the original main function and created a new 'main' in 'common/globals.c' with initialisation and clean-up. The use of '#pragma species initialize' is now deprecated, but a main function is required in the original code.
- Added the identification of a species' function, making variable definition detection local.
- Improved the compiler run-time for algorithms for which a skeleton is unavailable.
- Added a command-line option to be able to generate code for a single species only (-only_alg_number).
- Added a command-line option to set a fixed thread-merge factor (-merge_factor).
- Added a gemspec file.
- Updated the documentation and readme.

###################
### v1.0        ###
###################

General:
- Added a benchmark set to the examples directory based on the PolyBench/C benchmark set.
- Performed major code refactoring, improving maintainability and performance of Bones.
- Updated all examples to work with the upcoming 'automatic species extraction tool' (ASET).

Skeletons performance/readability/usability tuning:
- Updated the 'GPU-CUDA' reduction skeleton to support initial values, loops not starting at zero or not a power of 2, and more (see the new 'shared/example5.c').
- Improved the way skeletons are matched with species. Introduced a 'default' skeleton and modified others to accomodate these changes.

Improved code/species support:
- Added atomic support for OpenCL based targets
- Added support for loop iterator variables inside the 'algorithmic species' with selective memory copy for the 'GPU-CUDA' target, see 'element/example11.c'.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a compatibility problem with CAST version 0.2.0.

Miscellaneous:
- Added proper error messaging to catch various exceptions 
- Reversed the order of loop-flattening to obtain coalesced memory accesses (in particular for the 'GPU-CUDA' target).
- Renamed 'tile' into 'chunk', since 'tile' might imply using a 2D chunk of data.
- Changed '#pragma bones' into '#pragma species' to match the algorithmic species naming.
- Added a warning message for negative or zero range dimensions.
- Organized the search-and-replace parameters found in skeletons, renamed most of them and added a few new.
- Added headers to the code examples and cleaned them up.
- Added a warning message if an 'endkernel' pragma is missing.
- Improved the way error messages are thrown.

###################
### v0.9 (Beta) ###
###################

General:
- Implemented the new 'algorithmic species' using ranges, thus creating support for for-loops with affine functions as loop-bounds.
- Updated the examples

Supported targets:
- Changed the names of the targets 'GPU-OPENCL' and 'CPU-OPENCL' into 'GPU-OPENCL-AMD' and 'CPU-OPENCL-INTEL' respectively.
- Added a new target 'CPU-C' which implements a C-to-C pass-through.
- Added a new target 'CPU-OPENMP', which uses OpenMP to create 4 CPU threads.
- Added a new target 'CPU-OPENCL-AMD'. This target is similar to 'CPU-OPENCL-INTEL', but targets the AMD APP.

Skeletons performance/readability/usability tuning:
- Added a basic prefetching technique in the local memory for the neighbourhood skeleton for the 'GPU-CUDA' target.
- Removed the first entry in the transformation settings, which was used in previous versions to set the dimensions (now automatically detected).
- Changed the 'GPU-CUDA' skeletons such that host files can be compiled with a C99 compiler.
- Tuned 'CPU-OPENCL-INTEL' performance for Intel's OpenCL SDK.
- Created aligned memory allocation functions to enable zero-copy possibilities for the 'CPU-OPENCL-INTEL' target.
- Completed the addition of 'bones_' for every variable in the skeletons.

Verification code:
- Create a verification function specific to each output.
- Moved the verification code (including the original code) to a separate file, which is only generated if '-c' is provided as a flag to Bones.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug which would create function names starting with a digit.
- Adjusted the use of directory structures in the code for Windows-compatibility.
- Fixed a bug where variables for verification would have duplicate names.
- Fixed a bug where verification code would not compile for 'unsigned int' types.
- Fixed a memory leak which would occur when verification is enabled.
- Fixed a bug where statements of the form 'a[i]++' would not be recognized as input nor as output. They are now rewritten as 'a[i]=a[i]+1'.

Miscellaneous:
- Added support for selective copying-out (based on array access ranges)
- Added support for defines found in header functions (pre-processor now also pre-processes the header files)
- Added the possibility to specify the order of inputs/outputs in the classification by giving their names (if not given, the default ordering is assumed).
- Writing to a specific location in an array followed by a read no longer considers the array as input and output, it is now output only.
- Added a check to see if for-loops start and end as expected (as provided by the ranges given through the 'algorithmic species').
- Create a 'simplify' function, which simplifies math expressions to a certain extend. A test is included to give a few examples of what it can do.
- Clean-up of the Rakefile, addition of stub tasks to compile and execute example code, and the addition of an 'add new target' task.
- Changed the code such that the core components of Bones (the 'lib' folder) do not have to be adjusted to add a new target.
- Added performance measurement for original code in case verification is enabled.
- Renamed 'Tribe' into 'Species' and 'Primitive' into 'Algorithm'.
